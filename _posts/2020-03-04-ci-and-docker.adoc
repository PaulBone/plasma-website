# CI and docker images

We have two related announcements today:
continuous integration on our github repository and a docker image available
for testing or development.

## Continuous integration

A few times now
https://github.com/PlasmaLang/plasma/issues/199[people had reported]
that Plasma wouldn't build with
Mercury 14.01.1 which is the Mercury version we said we were compatible
with.
To prevent this from happening again, and also to ensure we test with
both gcc and clang C we've
https://github.com/PlasmaLang/plasma/issues/95[setup continuous integration].

Although now Mercury 14.01.1 is the previous Mercury release since
https://dl.mercurylang.org/release-20.01/release-notes-20.01.html[20.01]
and 20.01.1 are now available.
So Plasma is no-longer compatible with Mercury 14.01.1,
nevertheless, it's nice to know exactly what it works with at any time.

CI is also used to run an error-checking mode of the garbage collector and
run with +PZ_DEV+ both defined and undefined.

In the future we'd like to test across different operating systems and CPU
architectures.

## Docker images

To support CI we made some docker images containing Mercury and other Plasma
dependencies.  The CI system uses these to perform its builds and tests.

It was a small amount of extra work to build a more general 
https://github.com/PlasmaLang/plasma/blob/master/scripts/docker/Dockerfile[Dockerfile] 
(requires other files in the directory) and
https://hub.docker.com/r/paulbone/plasma-dep[docker image]
for Plasma development or testing.

This is based on Debian Linux and the Mercury packages for Debian,
it includes various other tools such as git and vim.
Vim is configured with syntax highlighting for Mercury and Plasma.

As always, feedback is welcome, file bugs if you find problems or have
suggestions.
