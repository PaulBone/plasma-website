title: Parametric Polymorphism
---

It's been some time but we've finally ticked off another goal on the
https://plasmalang.org/roadmap.html[roadmap].
The basics of parametric polymorphism work.
You can define a type, such as +List(a)+, note that a syntax sugar for list
cells and lists does not exist yet:

----
type List(a) = Nil 
             | Cons ( head : a, tail : List(a) )
----

Here +a+ is a type variable.  It can be substituted for any concrete type.

Write a polymorphic function:

----
func list_length(l : List(a)) -> Int {
    match (l) {
        Nil -> { return 0 }
        Cons(_, rest) -> { return 1 + list_length(rest) }
    }
}
----

And call it with a list of numbers, or strings, or any concrete type.

----
List1 = Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Cons(4, Nil))))
print!(int_to_string(list_length(List1)) ++ "\n")
        
List2 = Cons("A", Cons("B", Cons("C", Nil)))
print!(int_to_string(list_length(List2)) ++ "\n")
----

There are some rough edges to clean up, for example the compiler doesn't
check whether the correct number of types or variables are listed when
referring to a type (such as writing +List+ when one should write
+List(a)+).
And polymorphism will become much more useful once Plasma supports other
features such as higher order values/calls (next major goal) and interfaces.
