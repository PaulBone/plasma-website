title: Match-case statements
---

We've reached another minor milestone.  Match-case statements are now
supported including some rules for how variables are allowed to be used in
branching code.  This also means that Plasma is now Turing complete,
although it is far from being _expressive_.

Match statements attempt to match an expression against a number of patterns.
Currently the only patterns that are supported are integers, variable names
and underscore (a wild-card pattern).  Cases are tried in order.  Later the
compiler may warn about cases that are never executed (because an earlier
case matches).

    match (n) {
      0 -> {
        beer = "There's no beer!"
      } 
      1 -> {
        beer = "There's only one beer"
      }
      m -> {
        beer = "There are " ++ int_to_string(m) ++ " bottles of beer"
      }
    }
    print!(beer)

If a variable is produced by at least one case, and used outside the match
statement then it *must* be produced in all cases that _fall through_.  If a
variable is produced on at least one case, and not used outside the match,
then it will be _named apart_ by the compiler, allowing it to have a
different type from variables with the same name in other cases.  These
rules have been implemented however the error messages will abort
compilation.  Friendlier errors will be implemented later.

If it is possible that no case matches, and the other cases produce values
used after the match, then that is also an error.  However, until types are
properly implemented, we can't detect this error.

Cases may contain a return statement (or otherwise not _fall through_, if
that happens they do not need to produce any variables.  Currently the
compiler only supports either all cases falling through, or none falling
through.  I plan to implement this later, probably by transforming the code after the match into a separate function which is
called in the cases that fall through.  This will also have implications for
type checking due to the order of compilation passes, so it will have to wait until
then.
