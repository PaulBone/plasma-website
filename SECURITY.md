# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The master branch is the only "supported" version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Write an e-mail to `bugs@plasmalang.org`.  Do not submit a PR or issue, Github does not support "private" PRs and they
shouldn't be used to share information that could lead to users being harmed if shared publicly.
