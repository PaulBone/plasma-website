<h1>About</h1>

<p id="goal-imperative-declarative"
   id="goal-conc-and-par">
Combining the assurances of type safe, pure functional programming (FP) with the
efficiency and convenience of imperative programming will allow us to realise
the full potential of both. Plasma code is familiar to most programmers with
imperative features like loops and arrays. It backs this up with strong types,
no side-effects and the code-reuse of functional programming. Strong types and
lack of side-effects also enable painless concurrent and parallel programming,
including automatic parallelisation.
</p>
<p>
Just as gases expand to fill their container, Plasma programs (named for the
4th state of matter) will flow to utilise modern parallel hardware.
</p>
<p>
We have always needed reliable software that is easy to read and modify; while
the need to easily scale computing has emerged more recently as Moore’s law and
cache coherence restrict available performance. Plasma’s features are carefully
chosen based on these needs.
</p>

<p>
Many of these features are unimplemented, our
<a href="roadmap.html">roadmap</a>
shows the status of various features.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Side-effect free and single-assignment</dt>
<dd>
Without side-effects or rebinding a variable's value cannot change
unexpectedly,
helping programmers more confidently understand their
programs and debugging easier.
Side-effect free semantics also make it easier to apply many optimisations
including automatic parallelisation.
</dd>
<dt>Declared effects, such as IO</dt>
<dd>
Plasma uses a
<a href="docs/plasma_ref.html#resources">resource</a>
system to make effects (such as IO) safe.
Resources are composable unlike monads.
</dd>
<dt>Familiar procedural syntax</dt>
<dd>
We will support loops, arrays and other imperative programming features.
This benefits both experienced developers and novices.
<a href="docs/plasma_ref.html#loops">Loops</a> work on different aggregate
types and implement map, reduce, filter and combinations of these.
</dd>
<dt>A strong, static type system</dt>
<dd>supporting ADTs, parametric polymorphism,
  <a href="docs/plasma_ref.html#interfaces">interfaces</a>
  and type inference.</dd>
<dt>Simplicity</dt>
<dd>
Keeping things simple is an excellent engineering practice.
It also makes the language and tools easier to understand and benefits experienced programmers as well as novices.
When compared with functional programming:
  <ul>
    <li>Plasma will have a reduced emphasis and dependence on abstract
      	concepts like monads.</li>
    <li>Many <a href="docs/plasma_ref.html#interfaces">interfaces</a>
        will have more sensible names, eg:
        <code>Mappable</code> rather than <code>Functor</code>.</li>
    <li>We will also aim for good tooling and a consistent syntax;
        things that <span class="hl">are</span> different will
        <span class="hl">look</span> different.</li>
  </ul>
</dd>
<dt>Bytecode and native code</dt>
<dd>Generic token-based bytecode interpreter,
in the future more optimal bytecode interpreters for each major platform.
and hopefully native code generation.</dd>
<dt>Foreign Function Interface (FFI)</dt>
<dd>Interoperability with C.</dd>
<dt>Multiple concurrency abstractions</dt>
<dd>Tasks, channels, mvars, semaphores, streams, futures and software
  transactional memory provide safer abstractions than traditional
  threads and locks concurrency.
</dd>
<dt>Deterministic parallelism</dt>
<dd>Parallelise programs based on data-flow, loops and possibly pipelines
by adding annotations
Parallelism without concurrency is deterministic and side-effect free.
It won't constrain the structure of the program or have the
"what colour is your function?" problem.
</dd>
<dt>Automatic parallelisation</dt>
<dd>The compiler can automatically annotate the program to parallelise it.
