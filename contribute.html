<h1>How to contribute</h1>

<p>
Plasma is still a very new project, it can be difficult to contribute to
projects in their infancy until enough groundwork has been completed.
That said, Plasma is approaching a milestone where a lot of that groundwork
<i>has</i> now been completed
(<a href="roadmap.html">Roadmap</a>).
Now is an excellent time for the most determined contributors to jump-in.
Here's some info for how.
</p>

<h2>How to get started</h2>

<p>
Whether you want to contribute to Plasma or just use it, the first step is
building and trying it.
We have a
<a href="/docs/getting_started.html">getting started guide</a>
which should get you up-and-running with Plasma and its dependencies.
</p>

<h2>Ready to contribute?</h2>

<p>
Want to contribute but not sure where to start?
Try:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our open bug reports:
    <ul>
      <li>needs-help bugs.</li>
      <li>all open bugs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Maybe you've got a quick patch, checkout the
<a
   href="https://github.com/PlasmaLang/plasma/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"><code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code></a>
file.  Importantly these contain legal information such as what license
you agree to provide your code under.
</p>


<h2>Moral support and feedback</h2>

<p>
Have you tried Plasma?
If you tried it and like it, or just like what you have read here we'd be
very happy to hear about it.
Please tell us, hearing that someone else likes what you're doing really can
make a difference.
Oh, and don't forget to tell your friends!
</p>

<h2>Financial contribution</h2>

<p>
If financial contribution is more your style then please contact
myself, Paul Bone via e-mail (<code>plasma at plasmalang dot org</code>).
I'd love to have the opportunity to spend more time working on Plasma,
but haven't set anything up yet.
