<h1>How to contribute</h1>

<p>
Plasma is still a very new project, it can be difficult to contribute to
projects in their infancy until enough groundwork has been completed.
That said, Plasma is approaching a milestone where a lot of that groundwork
<i>has</i> now been completed
(<a href="roadmap.html">Roadmap</a>).
Now is an excellent time for the most determined contributors to jump-in.
Here's some info for how.
</p>

<h3>How to get started</h3>

<h3>What to work on</h3>

## What to contribute

The project is at an early stage and therefore we are prioritising work that
makes the language useful above things like adding compiler optimisations.
Additionally to make bootstrapping easier (into a self-hosted language) we
want to avoid adding code that is not necessary and will later need to be
re-written.  The project [roadmap](https://plasmalang.org/roadmap.html)
is a good place to look to know what our current and near-future focus is.

Before starting it is a good idea to
[discuss your ideas with us](https://plasmalang.org/lists/listinfo/dev),
we may be able to give you some pointers or let you know what kinds of
problems you may encounter.  Complex changes, especially those that require
some design decisions should be discussed before beginning work.  For
example we might not be interested n making the language weakly typed and
discussing this beforehand may avoid disappointment later.  Ultimately we
want you to enjoy working with Plasma and that means making the most of your
development time.

### Suggestions and good first bugs

If you're looking for a suggestion of what to contribute
please consider the
[open unassigned github
issues](https://github.com/PlasmaLang/plasma/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee)
and perhaps the
[project board](https://github.com/orgs/PlasmaLang/projects/1) to get an
idea of current priorities.
However you may work on other things also, these are only suggestions.

We label our issues within github to help searchability but also to provide
some ideas about what is involved with each issue.
Some issues have the
[good-first-bug](https://github.com/PlasmaLang/plasma/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+label%3A%22meta%3A+good-first-bug%22) label.
These tend to be really small changes that require relatively little
experience to complete.
They should take someone with a year of programming experience no more than
2 hours.
They might not be suitable for someone in their first month or two of
programming.
The
[no-domain-knowledge](https://github.com/PlasmaLang/plasma/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+label%3A%22meta%3A+no-domain-knowledge%22+)
label contains more difficult changes.
These may require a fair amount of programming experience but they do
not require any programming language implementation experience,
or otherwise have very clear help.

Other labels can indicate what component they are relevant to, for example:
'docs' or 'component: compiler'.  Or what skills may be required 'skill:
c'.  There is also a
[help wanted](https://github.com/PlasmaLang/plasma/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22meta%3A+help+wanted%22)
label for anything where people already involved with the project might not
have the skills we think are required.

There are also many `TODO` and `XXX` notes in the source code, which things
that are not handled.  Search for the strings `TODO` and `XXX`.  Keep in
mind that there may be good reasons why these are not yet handled, eg: it
may depend on other incomplete work.

If you find something undocumented whose behaviour is unlikely to change,
consider filling in that part of the documentation.

When reading code if something isn't clear, please ask us about it,
this is a good hint that we should have written (better) code comments.

  plasma at plasmalang dot org
* The license of your contribution must match the project's licenses:
  * Code: MIT
  * Docs: CC BY-SA 4.0
  * Build scripts, tests, and sample code: Unlicense
* No contributor agreement is required, you retain the copyright for your
  contribution.
* Add your name to the AUTHORS file.
* Please follow the style guides as much as possible (see below)

  below)
* By submitting a PR you acknowledge these terms and agree to the
  [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## How to contribute

Contributions are valuable and we want to make contributing as easy as
possible.  We can do this by providing support to contributors, especially
new contributors.  This can include providing feedback on your patches.
However by following the guidelines below contributors can decrease the
amount of support required, which gives everyone more time to write code and
contribute.

### Before beginning

It is best to start each piece of work on a new git branch.  Create a branch
off of master and commit your changes there as you go.

### Making your changes

If making a series of patches, try to organise the patches so that each
patch makes sense on its own.  Git has many features for doing this
including cherry picking and rebasing.

Code contributions should follow the style guides as much as possible.
Deviations that make code more readable are permitted.
The guides are
[Mercury style guide](https://plasmalang.org/docs/Mercury_style.html) and
[C style guide](https://plasmalang.org/docs/C_style.html).

TODO: Provide information about project structure.

Spell check and test your work, use ```make test``` for the latter.  Each patch
should, when applied in series, pass the test suite.

### Documenting your changes

User-visible changes including new options, features and behaviours must be
documented.  For now options are documented in the --help text of each
program.  While designs and concepts are documented in one of the files in
the the docs directory, these files are asciidoc text files.

### Submitting your changes

All code contributions must be made under the appropriate license:

* Code: MIT
* Docs: CC BY-SA 4.0
* Build scripts, tests, and sample code: Unlicense

No transfer of copyright or other rights or permissions is required.  All
contributors should be listed in the AUTHORS file, and all contributors with
copyrights _must_ be listed.

Log messages should follow the style:

```
  [component(s)] Title

  Description

  Any other changes including changes that were needed to support this
  change or followed as a concequence of this change.
```

We provide a .gitmessage in the root of the repository.
Run this command to start using the new commit message template:

```
git config --local commit.template /path/to/repo/.gitmessage
```

```components``` is one or more parts of the system.  This helps people
identify (in mailing lists, change logs etc) what kind of change has been
made at a glace.  It also helps people and software search for changes.
Current components are:

* pz: the PZ file format,
* rt: the runtime generally,
* rt/interp: the bytecode interpreter,
* rt/gc: the garbage collector,
* asm: the PZ assembler,
* compiler: the compiler generally,
* compiler/parse: the first phase: parsing.
* compiler/ast: the second phase: the AST and operations on it,
* compiler/pre: the third phase: the pre-core representation and operations,
* compiler/core: the fourth phase: the core representation and operations,
* compiler/pz: the fitht phase: the PZ code generator,
* docs: documentation,
* build: the build system,
* tests: the test suite,

Sometimes it makes sense to pick the component with the most sagnificant
changes rather than listing all of them.  This is typical for changes to the
compiler.

Each patch should contain a single change and changes required by that
change (should compile and pass tests).  Changes may e rolled together when
they're trivial related changes (eg, multiple spelling fixes).

We accept contributions via pull request on github, or via e-mailed patches.
If you choose to use e-mailed patches then the ```git format-patch``` and/or
```git send-email``` tools can be used to generate nice e-mails, however
this is not required, ```diff -uNr``` is sufficient.
E-mailed patches should be sent to the
[dev](https://www.plasmalang.org/lists/listinfo/dev) mailing list.

TODO: Provide suitable step-by-step instructions.

We aim to act on your changes reasonbly quickly.  However this is something
people do in their spare time, they may be busy with other aspects of their
lives and not reply for several days.  We will provide feedback and guidance
where appliable.  As stated abouve, we want you to enjoy working with Plasma
and that means we will try to help you make the most of your development
time.


<h2>Moral support and feedback</h2>

<p>
Have you tried Plasma?
If you tried it and like it, or just like what you have read here we'd be
very happy to hear about it.
Please tell us, hearing that someone else likes what you're doing really can
make a difference.
Oh, and don't forget to tell your friends!
</p>

<h2>Financial contribution</h2>

<p>
If financial contribution is more your style then please contact
myself, Paul Bone via e-mail (<code>plasma at plasmalang dot org</code>).
I'd love to have the opportunity to spend more time working on Plasma,
but haven't set anything up yet.
</p>
